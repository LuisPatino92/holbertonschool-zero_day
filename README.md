# Holberton School Project

>This repo is part of the Holberton School curriculum.

## Zero Day

This is the very first activity, the main objective is starting work with indispensable tools for programming, in this case, Vagrant, some wide used text editors as EMACS and VIM, and of course git.

As one of my first activities as a programmer, you are likely won't find anything interesting here, nevertheless, you are welcome to check what's here!

## In this REPO:

>**0x00-Vagrant**

The goal in this project was installing Vagrant and Virtualbox and download the box *Trusty-64*.

The first trimester in Holberton is about C and Shell. In order to have exactly the same configuration in compiler, and some enviroment variables it is a good idea to have the whole team working in similar machines. Vagrant allows the whole team to work with **exactly** the same configuration.

>**0x01-emacs**

The goal in  this project was know emacs, the text editor, and evaluate if it fits my needs.

Emacs is a powerful console based text editor. Its vast key-board shortcuts makes it one of the most used text editors for write code. In fact I used emacs a lot, but when projects become more complex (needed more files open at the same time, started debbuging, and the like), I moved to VSCode.

>**0x02-vi**

Basically the same as emacs, yes I know they are so different, but I mean that both are console based-text editors.

>**0x03-git**

A great version managment system. For Holberton School Projects we are going to use it with GitHub as server.

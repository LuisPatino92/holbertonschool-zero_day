# Holberton School Project

>This repo is part of the Holberton School curriculum.

## Zero Day

This is the very first activity, the main objective is starting work with indispensable tools for programming, in this case, Vagrant, some wide used text editors as EMACS and VIM, and of course git.

As one of my first activities as a programmer, you are likely won't find anything interesting here, nevertheless, you are welcome to check what's here!

Given the straigth-forward of these excersices, no further explanaition is needed abou the content of folders.
